# hep-ga

## Project description
hep-ga is a C++11 library for efficient numeric calculations with geometric
algebra. It provides a template class for multi-vectors of G_{p,q} and
template-expressions for many operations such as addition, geometric product,
inner and outer product.

hep-ga was originally developed by Christopher Schwan (https://github.com/cschwan/hep-ga)
